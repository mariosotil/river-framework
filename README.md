## What is the River Framework?

Hi, 

This is a Workflow Application Framework in a **VERY EARLY development stage**. This first version only has the following features: 

- It is using IBM Notes as NoSQL server
- It lets you connect to an IBM Notes database and the possibility to access its views and create or modify documents.
- It has a set of JUnit tests


## What is in the ToDo list?

There are a lot of features that I want to add to this framework:

- The main goal of the project: the support of workflow development with the features that are needed for the task:
  - Control of the states of the document
  - Control of the responsables on each state
  - Control of the permissions to read on each state
  - etc.
- Relation between documents (1..\*, \*..\*)
- Another etc.


## Why I created this Framework?

Over the last years (many years!), I have been working as IBM Notes workflow application developer at my current job. And as so often happens, after some time I started to feel really bored developing similar applications once and again. So, as own-initiative, I started to develop a Workflow Framework in LotusScript, the native IBM Notes programming language. The goal of the framework was simplify the development grouping the similar tasks together, letting me focus on the differences between applications. It was really useful and fun to work on! 

Well, one year ago, it seemed like a good idea to publish that work as an open source project and share it with another IBM Notes developers that maybe can find it useful too. I asked to my employer but, for contractual issues, I couldn't publish the source code written in working hours. It's understandable. So, I started to design and write a new one in Java *in my spare time, in my home* some months ago (in case my boss is reading this :-). The design will incorporate all the features that I would like to have, but I couldn't add because LotusScript language limitations. 

I expected that this work be useful for you. I'll be looking forward for your ideas, comments or questions at mario.sotil@gmail.com
